# schedule-fa

A Go CLI that turns **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** holdings into a ready-to-use
**Schedule FA** (Foreign Assets) report for the Indian ITR — handling the calendar-year
basis, SBI TT buying-rate conversion to INR, and peak/closing/initial values per
security, with a full audit trail.

See [`docs/schedule-fa-ibkr-plan.md`](docs/schedule-fa-ibkr-plan.md) for the research,
challenges, locked decisions, architecture, and milestones.

## Status

- **M1 — IBKR ingest** ✅ — parses a downloaded Activity Flex XML (account, open positions
  with lot detail, trades, dividends with withholding matched), constrained to the calendar
  year. `generate` prints a parse summary.
- **M2 — FX engine** ✅ — `fx.CSVStore` reads the community SBI FX RateKeeper format and
  converts to INR with preceding-working-day fallback and per-figure audit records.
- **M3 — Table A3 + reports** ✅ — approximate peak (mode C) + row builder produce Table A3
  (initial/peak/closing/dividend/proceeds in INR, audit trail, review flags), rendered to
  **Markdown, CSV, and JSON**. `generate` now runs the full pipeline and writes the report.

Next: M4 (exact peak from daily prices), then M5 (Table A2 + entity metadata + edge cases).

## Usage (target)

```sh
schedulefa generate \
  --year 2024 \                          # CALENDAR year (Jan 1 – Dec 31), enforced
  --statement private/flex-2024.xml \    # IBKR Activity Flex Query, XML output (offline mode)
  --rates data/ttbr/usd.csv \            # optional SBI TTBR override
  --out private/report --format md,csv,json   # output defaults under gitignored private/
```

> Keep real Flex exports under `private/` (gitignored) — they contain your account
> number, address, and holdings and must never be committed. For a full Schedule FA you
> want a **complete past calendar year** (e.g. a Jan 1–Dec 31 export), not a year-to-date one.

## Build

```sh
go build ./cmd/schedulefa       # from the schedule-fa/ directory
```

## Notes

- Native mode with mixed currencies (INR, USD): these correlations blend asset and FX co-movement. Pass --base-currency (with --fx) to normalise to one currency.
- Small sample: only 8 weekly return observations. Correlations are noisy; prefer a longer window or a lower frequency.

> NOTE: not investment advice. Correlations are backward-looking, sample-dependent, and unstable in crises (they often rise toward 1 exactly when diversification is needed most).

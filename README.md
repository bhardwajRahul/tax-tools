# tax-tools

A monorepo of small, focused tools for Indian tax filing from broker/financial data.
Each tool is an isolated Go module under its own directory, tied together by a root
`go.work` workspace.

## Tools

| Tool            | Directory                      | Status           | What it does                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **schedule-fa** | [`schedule-fa/`](schedule-fa/) | scaffolding (M0) | Generates a ready-to-use **Schedule FA** (Foreign Assets) report for the Indian ITR from **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** holdings. |

## Layout

```
tax-tools/
  go.work            # ties all tool modules together
  schedule-fa/       # each tool: its own go.mod, cmd/, internal/, docs/, data/
  …                  # future tools as sibling directories
```

## Building

Requires Go (not currently installed on this machine — `brew install go`).

```sh
go build ./...        # from repo root, builds every module in the workspace
```
